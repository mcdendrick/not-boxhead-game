Game Specification: "Not Boxhead" - 3D First-Person Zombie Shooter with Three.js
"Not Boxhead" will be a 3D first-person shooter where players fight against waves of zombies in enclosed arenas. 
The game will maintain the core mechanics of the original Boxhead series but with modern 3D graphics and first-person perspective.

Technical Stack
Frontend Framework: Three.js for 3D rendering
Physics: Cannon.js or Ammo.js for physics calculations
Audio: Howler.js for sound management
Build System: Vite or Webpack for bundling
Language: JavaScript/TypeScript
Deployment: Web-based (playable in modern browsers)


Advantages of Using Three.js
Web-based: No downloads required, playable directly in browser
Open Source: Complete control over the codebase
Lightweight: Faster loading times compared to Unity WebGL exports
Cross-platform: Works on any device with a modern browser
Direct Code Access: No black-box engine components
Active Community: Large community with many resources and examples

Getting Started with Three.js Implementation
To begin development, I recommend the following steps:
Set up a basic project structure with Vite/Webpack
Create a simple Three.js scene with first-person controls
Implement basic movement and collision detection
Add simple placeholder models for testing

# Not Boxhead Game Development Rules

## File Management
- Read all files in a directory before making changes
- Keep track of dependencies between files to understand the impact of changes
- Document the purpose of each file in comments at the top

## Error Resolution
- Fix one linter error at a time
- Make sure all linter errors are taken care of
- Group related errors when they have a common cause

## Code Organization
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across all files
- Keep class methods organized by functionality (constructor, getters/setters, core logic, etc.)
- Use proper TypeScript typing for all variables and function returns


## Implementation Strategy
- Ensure backward compatibility when extending existing classes

## Documentation
- Document public methods with clear descriptions
- Add TODO comments for future improvements
- Include examples for complex logic

## Prompt Processing
- Carefully read and understand the entire prompt
- Identify core concerns and requests
- Address each of the concerns/requests directly and completely
- Prioritize responding to what is explicitly asked for
- Only after addressing specific requests additional information be considered
- Before adding any extra information beyond what is requested, please ask if additional insights or suggestions would be considered
